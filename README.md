### My Role

In my role as a user experience designer, I covered the entire spectrum of the UX design process, requiring a deep understanding of users and the capability to translate that understanding into a design that met their needs and preferences. I began with conducting research and defining UX requirements, gathering insights into user behavior, needs, and pain points. Building InVision prototypes and conducting usability tests allowed me to iterate on my designs, ensuring they were intuitive and user-friendly. Mapping out the user journey and designing the visuals and branding were critical steps in creating a cohesive and engaging experience that resonated with the target audience.

### Goals

My primary goal was to transition Tu Piel y Tú into an unbranded content site, focusing on creating engagement and advocacy. This objective was challenging and rewarding, as it required designing an experience that attracted and retained users based on the quality and relevance of the content, rather than the strength of the brand name. I aimed to foster a community of users who felt connected to the content, found value in it, and were motivated to advocate for the site through word-of-mouth or social sharing.

### Design Process

I took a structured approach to the design process, emphasizing both creative and analytical methods:

1. **Interviews and Persona Development:** Conducting interviews helped me understand the diverse needs and motivations of our target users. Developing personas based on these interviews enabled me to design with a specific, relatable user in mind, making my design decisions more focused and effective.

2. **Stakeholder’s Map and Business Model Canvas:** Mapping out stakeholders and using a business model canvas provided a clear understanding of the ecosystem around Tu Piel y Tú, including key relationships, value propositions, and business objectives. This step ensured that my UX design aligned not only with user needs but also with business goals.

3. **Customer Journey Map and User Journey:** Creating detailed maps of both the customer and user journeys offered insights into the full experience of interacting with Tu Piel y Tú, from initial awareness through engagement and beyond. These maps were crucial for identifying pain points and opportunities to enhance the user experience.

4. **Wireframes and Prototype:** Developing wireframes and a prototype was a hands-on phase where my conceptual work began to take concrete shape. This step allowed for rapid iteration and refinement of ideas, providing a tangible basis for usability testing.

5. **Test:** Conducting usability tests with real users provided invaluable feedback on the design, highlighting areas where the user experience could be improved and validating the effectiveness of the solutions I had implemented.

By integrating these methods and tools into my design process, I addressed the complex challenge of converting a branded blog into a compelling unbranded content site. This approach not only improved the user experience but also aligned it with L'Oréal's strategic objectives of creating engagement and advocacy without direct branding. This project showcases the power of UX design to shape digital experiences that resonate with users and drive business goals.
